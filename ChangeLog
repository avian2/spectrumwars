2015-10-16	spectrumwars 0.0.6

	* Renamed "Transmitter" to "Source" and "Receiver" to "Destination" in
	  the public Transceiver API to reduce confusion regarding the fact
	  that Destination node can also send packets back to Source node. Old
	  class names are still supported by the game controller.
	* Moved sandbox-specific code into separate modules under
	  spectrumwars.testbed.
	* Fixed problems with some unit tests randomly failing due to race
	  conditions when using the mocked testbed class.
	* [VESNA firmware] fixed problem with insufficient RX channel filter
	  bandwidth that caused packet loss on some specific pairs of nodes.
	* [VESNA firmware] blink LED on packet transmission.

2015-08-27	spectrumwars 0.0.5

	* Refactor payload packing out of testbed-specific code. See reference
	  for RADIO_CLASS attribute in Testbed class and PACKET_SIZE, binsend()
	  and binrecv() in Radio class.
	* Documentation improvements - split documentation into Player's and
	  Developer's guides.
	* Improved game visualizations. spectrumwars_plot now also makes a game
	  overview plot in addition to player specific plots.
	* Record package counts separately for RX -> TX and TX -> RX.
	* Various minor bug fixes.
	* PyPi package.

2015-08-17	spectrumwars 0.0.4

	* Add "--testbed" parameter to spectrumwars_runner for specifying the
	  testbed to be used.
	* Add a testbed simulation class for developing player code without
	  access to real hardware.
	* Make usrp_sensing.SpectrumSensor class usable in different testbed.
	* Add documentation for developing testbed-specific classes.
	* Automatically skip tests for hardware that is not currently
	  connected.

2015-06-19	spectrumwars 0.0.3

	* Use USB CDC connection with VESNA nodes instead of serial-to-USB
	  converters.
	* Node now waits for packet transmission to conclude before returning
	  from "t" commmand.
	* Implement missing query methods (get_configuration,
	  get_frequency_range, etc.)

2015-06-11	spectrumwars 0.0.2

	* Rework interface between transceiver and game controller to be
	  compatible with RPC.
	* Add sandbox infrastructure.
	* Subprocess sandboxing for player's code.

2015-05-14	spectrumwars 0.0.1

	* First release
