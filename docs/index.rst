Welcome to SpectrumWars documentation!
======================================

SpectrumWars is a work-in-progress programming game where players compete for
bandwidth on a limited piece of a radio spectrum.

This is part of the effort in the `FP7 CREW project
<http://www.crew-project.eu/>`_ to make a computer
controlled version of the game that was demonstrated at various conferences
(see for example `FOSDEM 2014 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7sUI8I7gI>`_,
`Net Futures 2015 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-Js5pwuVFA>`_). The aim is
to replace a joystick-wielding human with a short, fun to write Python script.

This Python implementation for VESNA sensor nodes was written by Tomaz Solc
(tomaz.solc@ijs.si)

*This work has been partially funded by the European
Community through the 7th Framework Programme project
CREW (FP7-ICT-2009-258301).*
