Running examples
================

To run a game with a single player that is specified by code in
``examples/better_cognitive.py``::

   $ spectrumwars_runner -l example.log examples/better_cognitive.py

``spectrumwars_runner`` automatically finds any USB-connected nodes and
assigns them randomly to players.

.. note::
   As of 0.0.3, ``spectrumwars_runner`` no longer uses nodes connected over
   serial-to-USB converters.

In the end, it prints out some game statistics::

   Results:
   Player 1:
       crashed             : False
       transmitted packets : 95
       received packets    : 51 (54%)
       transferred payload : 12801 bytes (avg 1099.6 bytes/s)
   Game time: 11.6 seconds

It also saves a binary log file to ``example.log``. In addition to the ASCII
log that is printed on the console, the binary log contains useful debugging
information about events that occurred during the game. You can visualize the
log by running::

   $ spectrumwars_plot -o example.out example.log

This creates a directory ``example.out`` with one image per player. For
the example above, ``example.out/player0.png`` should look something like
this:

.. image:: figures/example_game.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

Left graph shows the progress of the game in a time-frequency diagram. Key
events in the game are displayed in form of markers: Red markers show events
from the ``Receiver`` class. Circles show successfully received packets.
Crosses show radio reconfigurations (i.e.  ``set_configuration()`` method
calls). Horizontal lines show spectral scans. A scan is shown each time the
class requests it using ``get_status()`` method or when the
``status_update()`` event happens. In a similar fashion, green markers show
events from the ``Transmitter`` class. Crosses again show radio
reconfigurations while exes show packet transmissions.

Right graph shows progress of performance indicators: percentage of
transferred payload required by the game and number of transmitted and
received packets.
